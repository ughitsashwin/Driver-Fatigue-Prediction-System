# Driver-Fatigue-Prediction-System
This project focuses on developing a machine learning system to detect driver drowsiness using facial recognition techniques. Drowsiness is a significant contributor to road accidents, particularly in the taxi industry, and this system aims to improve safety by identifying signs of fatigue in drivers.
